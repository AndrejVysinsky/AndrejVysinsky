My first game made with Unity. Main goal of the game is to destroy all blocks while having at least 1 ball on screen. Blocks have a chance to drop random power up with varying effects.

## Web development :globe_with_meridians:

### QR Game

Web application made with ASP.NET Core MVC. The main purpose is the creation of questions and contests based on scanning QR codes. It provides contestants with the means of answering questions and viewing their results. Scanning is possible using the added library for recognizing QR codes. For site administrators, application allows to create multiple-answer questions with option to add images. Subsequently, they can compose contests from the created questions and generate QR codes for them. The application includes the ability to export answers to competitions to an .xlsx file for a summary of contestantsâ€™ points. The administrator oversees managing users and their privileges.
